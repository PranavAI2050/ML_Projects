 

## Overview

This project aims to provide a user-friendly graphical interface for creating machine learning models without the need for coding. The focus is on digit classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). With this GUI, users can effortlessly train, evaluate, and deploy CNN models for recognizing hand-written digits.

## Features

- **No Code Required:** Easily build, train, and evaluate CNN models without writing any code.
  
- **Digit Classification:** Specifically designed for digit recognition tasks using CNNs.

- **Intuitive GUI:** User-friendly graphical interface for a seamless experience.

- **Model Deployment:** Once trained, deploy the model for real-time digit classification.

## Usage

1. **Run the GUI application:**

    ```bash
    python Classification.py
    ```

2. Use the intuitive interface to:
   - Load and preprocess digit images.
   - Train the CNN model with a few clicks.
   - Evaluate model performance.
   - Deploy the trained model for digit classification.

We welcome contributions! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](
     https://github.com/PranavAI2050/ML_Projects.git).


### Additional Functionalities

We are open to enhancing the GUI with additional functionalities. If you have ideas or would like to work on features like:

- **Dynamic Training:** Address the issue where the model trains every time a prediction is attempted.
  
- **External Data Integration:** Allow users to add data from external sources and provide labels.

- **Interactive Training Interface:** Integrate a feature to show real-time training progress or allow users to draw images for training instead of uploading.

Please feel free to discuss your plans in the GitHub issues or propose your changes via pull requests. Your contributions are valuable!
